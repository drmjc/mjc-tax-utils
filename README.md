# tax-utils
Some hopefully useful utilities to help with preparing Australian tax returns, such as 
1. tracking work-related travel (google maps + RTA eToll statements)
2. Bunnings expenses
3. renaming monthly banking statements based on their dates
4. that's it for now...

# future ideas
It would be great to parse
1. Online Woolworths/coles orders
2. Supercheap auto
3. invoices that go through flybuys?

# about me / why this repo
I have a primary job as a scientist, but I also live on a small farm, rent out a cottage through Airbnb, and have a very long commute. That means lots of tax-deductible expenses for DIY, car, farm and cottage maintenance. These scripts aim to make life easier to collate all the data at the end of the year
